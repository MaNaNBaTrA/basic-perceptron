# Perceptron from Scratch

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron algorithm using NumPy.

The Perceptron is one of the earliest and simplest binary classification algorithms, introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt. It learns a linear decision boundary to separate two classes.

## Features

- Implemented from scratch using NumPy
- Uses step activation function
- Includes random sample-based weight update (stochastic gradient descent)
- Easy to understand and modify
